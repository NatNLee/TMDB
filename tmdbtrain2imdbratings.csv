It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.",14.319742999999999,12/26/59,212,Ben-Hur,146900000,0,4,Action Adventure Drama History,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,6,31,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,3,23,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,4,6,12,4,3,4,2,6,2,0,0,8.1,214854,8,8,44325,44856,63035,35510,13420,5764,2514,1546,1224,2660,8,92,8.1,26638,8,86661,8.2,42675,8.1,141034,8,72,8.1,22656,8.1,75252,8.2,36267,7.9,21079,7.7,15,7.8,3658,7.8,10507,8,5820,8,734,8.2,39874,8,95698

Ilya is a character close to the ""hooker with a heart of gold"" clich√©. Homer feels Ilya's life style typifies the degradation of Greek classical culture and attempts to steer her onto the path of morality. It constitutes a variation of the Pygmalion story.  The film stars Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin, and it gently submerges the viewer into Greek culture, including dance, music, and language (through the use of subtitles).

The film earned a reputation as being one of the most violent films ever made up to that point and was subsequently refused a certificate in Britain until 1993, when it was eventually issued an 18 certificate. Subsequent to this the film was downgraded to a 15 certificate in 2004. Although the name is referenced in over thirty ""sequels"" from the time of the film's release until the mid 1980s in an effort to capitalize on the success of the original, none of these films were official, featuring neither Corbucci nor Nero. Nero did reprise his role as Django in 1987's Django 2: Il Grande Ritorno (Django Strikes Again), in the only official sequel to be written by Corbucci.",4.8916379999999995,4/5/66,93,Django,17277,1,2,Action Western,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,5,1,0,1,3,2,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,3,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,7.2,24223,7.3,7,2129,2451,6529,7509,3409,1203,477,218,123,175,7.2,9,7.4,3659,7.2,11438,7,4422,7.2,19020,7.3,8,7.4,3435,7.3,10728,7,4151,7.1,1005,7,1,7.3,185,6.9,569,7.2,209,6.7,383,7.4,3778,7.2,13794

1912,0,tt1541666,en,Circo,"Tino Ponce operates Circo Mexico, which journeys across the Mexican countryside in search of paying customers. Wanting to please his father and continue the family business, Ponce has recruited his young children as performers while laboring night and day to maintain the circus's faltering financial fortunes. But a growing resentment brewing within his wife about their hardscrabble existence suggests troubles on the horizon. While documenting the brutal regimen of circus life, Circo also peels back the curtain on the Ponce family's inner dynamics, revealing generational divides and money worries that threaten to tear apart a marriage. Buttressed by indie-rock band Calexico's evocative score, Schock's film observes this family drama with a sympathetic but clear-eyed view of a vanishing way of life.

The key to that success is simply that The Clan is based on one of the most shocking crimes in the country‚Äôs history, the Puccio Clan case. In 1985, the news broke that the Puccios, a well-established Catholic family with five children from San Isidro, an upper-class suburb of Buenos Aires, kidnapped and held people hostage for ransom in their own home. The film is a disturbing, impressive, and beautifully controlled interpretation of those events, with Guillermo Francella's magnificent depiction of the father, a performance for the ages.",7.789039999999999,8/13/15,110,The Clan,20381995,0,4,Crime Drama History Thriller,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,1,7,6,2,1,0,2,1,1,1,0,1,1,3,0,0,0,9,1,1,0,3,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,7,11865,7,7,443,819,2866,4385,2110,723,229,94,64,132,6,2,7.1,1834,6.9,5133,7,2060,6.9,7969,6,2,7,1411,6.9,4279,6.9,1799,7.1,1513,,,7.1,396,7,763,7.1,225,6.4,126,6.8,456,6.9,6935

It was adapted from a novella by Wenders' long-time collaborator Peter Handke. A goalkeeper is sent off during a game for committing a foul. He spends the night with a cinema cashier, whom he afterwards kills. Although a type of detective film, it is more slow moving and contemplative than other films of the genre. It explores the monotony of the murderer's existence and, like many of Wenders' films, the overwhelming cultural influence of America in post-war West Germany.",0.769053,2/19/72,101,The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,100,0,2,Crime Drama,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,6.6,1578,6.7,7,88,122,283,454,334,152,72,30,21,22,6.5,2,6.8,180,6.6,567,6.6,495,6.6,1140,6.5,2,6.8,153,6.6,505,6.5,450,6.7,130,,,7,23,6.5,56,6.8,43,6.4,95,6.6,222,6.6,923
